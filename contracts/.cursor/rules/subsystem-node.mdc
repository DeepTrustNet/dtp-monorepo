# Managing nodes

## Node functionalities
- Stake a minimum amount and assign a worker for the node?
- Register a node (node_id, node namespaces, namesapce owner signatures) [only staker]
- update node (add / remove namespaces, add / remove models served)
- activate / deactivate node
- set models to serve (model namespace, id, request price / byte, response price / byte)

## Score management
- node scores (reponse rate, valid answer rate, complain rate)

## Node seletion algorithm
- A deterministic node-selection for each model namespace, and quality filter, and pricing
