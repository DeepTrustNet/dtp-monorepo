# Project specifications

We are building smart contracts for DeepTrust Network (DTN). DTN is divided in to the following sub-systems. Each will have its own set of SCs, and there is a core sub-system to connect all parts together:

- The node subsytem: @subsystem-node : Main node management functionalities
- The model subsystem: @subsystem-model : Main model management functionalities
- The session subsystem: @subsystem-session : Main session management functionalities
- The dapp subsystem @subsystem-dapp : Main interface for dapps to use models
- The core subsystem @subsystem-core : Contains data types and interfaces for all other subsystems

Note: all solidity contracts must be upgradeable using UUPSUpgreable pattern
