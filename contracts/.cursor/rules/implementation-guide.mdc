# NFT AI Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step requirements for implementing the NftAi project, which creates AI-generated NFTs using a two-step process: image generation and metadata creation. Note we need to maintain flexibility of the underlying contracts as their real goal is to build a platform.

## Implementation Steps

1- Implement V0.1 contracts
Some basic logic for all sub-systems. Everything implemented under router

2- Add tests
Have some tests around each sub-system
Have an end-to-end integration test around nft-ai

3- Deploy and configure scripts
Deploy and configure on testnet and mainnet

4- Dummy node
A dummy node implementation (e.g. Hello-world model) that is not really AI but implements all the features for testing

5- End-to-end test
Deploy one mainnet
Launch dummy node
Create AI-NFT using etherscan calls or a script

6- Documentation
Developer documentation
Node builder documentation
